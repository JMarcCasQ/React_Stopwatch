Hi there!

As I am learning deeper into React.js, I have tried creating a stopwatch that utilizes the useRef, useState, and useEffect.

Yeah it's simple but hey, like they said "Many a mickle makes a muckle"

How to run this?
1. Clone the repository
2. Using your preferred terminal, locate the file directory
3. Run npm run dev
4. Copy the given Local link generated by the terminal (e.g. locahost:5173)
5. Paste it on your preferred browser.

Well if you want to test it without cloning, just visit this Vercel Link:
